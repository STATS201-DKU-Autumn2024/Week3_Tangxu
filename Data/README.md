# Predictive Maintenance Data for Vehicle Systems

This project uses two comprehensive datasets to explore predictive maintenance in vehicle systems. The **MetroPT dataset** (Veloso et al. 2022) provides a detailed archive of maintenance activities, operational metrics, and failure events from Lisbon's metro system. It is structured to support predictive maintenance modeling, offering valuable insights into operational patterns and component degradation.

Additionally, the **Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set** (Saxena and Goebel 2008) from NASAâ€™s Prognostics Data Repository includes time-series sensor data on turbofan engines under simulated degradation conditions. This dataset captures real-time wear patterns in high-stress components, supporting the development of models focused on early failure detection.

These datasets allow for the integration of multimodal data to enhance predictive maintenance across transportation sectors.
